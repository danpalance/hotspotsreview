Here, Myers identified 10 areas that had extraordinarily high levels of endemic species under threat from human activity. Myers coined the term hotspot to mean areas that ""feature exceptional concentrations of species with exceptional endemism, and that, face excepetional degrees of threat."" He focused on higher/vasular plants due to a lack of data on animal species. The 10 iconic areas were Madagascar, the Atlantic Coast of Brazil, Western Ecuador, the Colombian Chocó, the Uplands of Western Amazonia, the Eastern Himalayas, Peninsular Malaysia, Northern Borneo, the Philippines, and New Caledonia. Myers then briefly summarized two hotspot areas in the developed world, Hawaii and Queensland, where extinction threats can be much more easily managed due to a greater abundance of conservation resources. He concludes by discussing the importance of protecting these hotspot areas with parks and preserves to mitigate extinction, but acknowledges the ""islandizing effect,"" that delayed fallout may still occur, and that the effects of climate change will disrupt the areas no matter what precautions are taken.

The issue being that many species that makeup the hotspots have wide ranges and occur outside of the hotspot areas, so it is challenging to determine how much hotspots are driven by endemic species with small ranges. The authors approached this question by looking at the contribution of fish and coral to species assemblages at different locations and how range size changes with distance from a hotspot. To do so, they compiled a database of 65 species ranges from the literature. Their results showed overwhelmingly that a majority of species making up these marine hotspots were not endemic. Dispersal mechanisms played a role in pandemicity, with broadcast spawners being found more spread out. The authors also refute Rapoport’s rule, the fact that smaller range sizes occur at lower latitudes, and also found no evidence for smaller range sizes at species richness peaks, another conventional belief. The authors conclude that conservation efforts should shift from protecting biodiversity to protecting connectivity and genetic diversity of wide ranging species as well as proximate areas with relatively higher numbers of endemics.

The authors used scientific observer data from long-line fisheries in the US and Australian between 1991-2000, focusing on swordfish fishery in the NW Atlantic and Tuna fisheries in Hawaii and Australia. They also used vessel logbook data to get better size and spatial coverage with the tradeoff of lower taxonomic resolution. Data were binned into 2 degree hexagonal cells and the authors used standard rarefaction techniques to look at species richness and species density. The sample sizes of species richness and density were 50 individuals and 1000 hooks, respectively. To minimize variation in the model they accounted for differences in spatial scale, depths, season, and varied the number of indivuals in the standard sample. Using data from the Northwest Atlantic, a closed area model was constructed to investigate whether hotspot closures were the best conservation method to offset fishery pressure. The model showed that hotspot closure is the best and only option that would result in significant conservation benefits. Hotspots were most common near topographic features like seamounts and shelf breaks, and most concentrated in intermediate latitudes. This relationship was consistent on a global scale. High catch rates were found in areas of low diversity, suggesting hotspots are not high fish production areas. High catches were found at higher latitudes. Closing non-hotspot areas either had a weak effect or actually resulted in harmful reallocation of effort. Overall, these results suggest that fishery effort should be controlled along with hotspot closures. There were similar latitudinal patterns in species diversity across five zooplankton taxa. Overall hotspot patterns suggest overlap with different trophic groups, and that major topographic and oceanographic features may be important factors that concentrate food for top predators.

Conservation efforts should be moving away from single species approaches and taking a more holistic tactic by looking at ecosystems, assemblages, and communities. The connectivity of marine systems and range of many top predators makes defining reserve boundaries difficult, particularly when implementing reserves with the goal of protecting these predators. Many reserves in the past were on paper only, with no management or enforcement backup. The authors then decided to focus on the impact of reserves on marine top predators and multispecies/multipurpose reserves with the addition of fishery enhancement. Even though marine mammals have massive ranges, the protection of parts of these could still be beneficial as threats can be either site specific or cumulative. Until recently, most reserves were not developed with a rigorous scientific basis, and employed more of an ad hoc design. The authors suggest including demographic modeling and mortality to assess effectiveness of protection when designing reserves, with fecundity being most important for short lived species and adult/juvenile survival for long-lived species. Species interactions should also be accounted for, as they could alter desired reserve outcomes. To address the potential competing demands of protecting top predators and fisheries, a reserve area could be split in two with one focused on ecosystem integrity and the other on fishery production. They launch into a brief discussion on hotspots and propose their own definition as areas of increased productivity relative to other ocean areas, and that there is increasing evidence that predators could serve as indirect indicators of prey abundance and distributions. They advocate for quantitative methods to identify reserve areas, and that scientists and managers must commit to robust plans for monitoring and policing to ensure their efforts aren’t futile, as well as public buy-in, perhaps the most important.

Common characteristics to many of the hotspots were the effects of bathymetry and coastal forcing, often in tandem with winds. While many hotspots are ephemeral, those described in this paper tended to be more robust given the permanence of the oceanographic features behind them. For instance, in the CCS, long-lived mesoscale eddies result in the retention of coastal pelagic fish species. Similarly, a lot of variation in the CNP is due to eddies originating from the Kuroshio Extension. Subsurface waves also have similar effects in other areas.

SSH data were mapped at 0.3 degree resolution and chlorophyll-a in a 4.89 km pixel resolution. Tracks revealed that turtles were using the perimeter of warm core eddies. Turtles from both groups traveled to the KEBR and stayed there upon arriving, indicating it is an abundance hotspot. The authors propose this likely has to do with prey. Turtles moved out of the KEC areas and into the TZCF in the third quarter of the year when chlorophyll-a levels are low. Turtles were shown to use both cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, the latter of which was suprising since upwelling occurs at the center and not the edge. It could be that shallow water prey concentrate on the edge and turtles take advantage of this. ",N,"SSH, chl-a, currents, primary productivity, eddies","circulation, primary productivity",,,,

After a brief review of marine fronts, they use the term ""frontal feature"" moving forward as their temperature gradients were less than the official definition of a front put forth by Fedorov (1986).

The authors note that animals have not been used to define a gradient, and this could be a tool to ID biological hotspots. The authors assumed that high residence times (>10 days in a 100km radius) were indicative of foraging by blue whales. Both blue whales and sea turtles had been observed feeding on pelagic red crab. An edge detection algorithm based on a 3x3 moving window across a grid was utilized to define a frontal feature density and persistence. Chl-a and upwelling were also examined in tandem for comparison as well as topographic features such as the shelf break and sea mounts. Results showed that both whales and turtles spent a lot of time around these fronts, meandering and traveling in a linear fashion along them. Some fronts persisted for more than 3 months and likely serve to aggregate prey such as pelagic red crab, which many of the taxa studied have been obeserved feeding on. Simliar fronts were shown to exist off the Channel Islands, another area blue whales show meandering behavior. Whales and turtles followed frontal features that had values on the lower end of the physical oceanography values. The authors discuss a few alternatives for why the animals congregate around these fronts, such as salinity gradients, oxygen minimum zone, and mixed layer depth.

Large groups were commonly found with fishing vessels in Alaska, with one observation by a fisherman containing 10% of the global population around a single fishing boat. Scientists used to think the short-tailed albatross was a coastal species due to the abundant bones found in middens along the US West Coast. These are since better explained by the midden proximity to oceanographic processes created by shelf breaks and canyons that enhance upwelling and aggregate prey for the birds. There was some initial concern that because the datasets used did not have effort data, there may be a strong bias in the data for where albatross were observed. However, it was found that the majority of the surveys were far ranging with sightings randomly distributed, decreasing much of the bias.

""About 80% of cetations spend most of their lives or have at least some essential habitat on the high seas 'Hoyt 2005'."" This makes management and jurisdiction complicated due to the high seas. A criticism of MPAs on the high seas is that species are too mobile to be protected effectively. The authors counter by stating they can be protected where it most matters such as breeding/nursery grounds and migration corridors. They also suggest using dynamic MPAs built around large-scale oceanographic features such as seamounts or chlorophyll fronts. Those that are fixed, i.e. bathmyetry based, would be more easily protected, while those tied to more dynamic features like upwelling could be more difficult. The authors cite that large MPAs should contain 50% or more of a population's natural habitat. and that interconnectivity between reserves is essential. The Gully Marine protected area was then described as a case study. The Gully is split into 3 different zones, the first of which being the most restrictive and based on depths deeper than 600m to protect the year round resident northern bottlenose whale. Zone 2 protects benthic communities and excludes net and mobile fishing gear to prevent damage to cnayon heads and sides, and zone 3 is the shallow sand banks on the sides of the canyon with commercial activities assessesd on a case by case basis. Hook and line fisheries are permitted in zones 2 and 3 but not zone 1. MPAs must have strict and meaningful regulations to be effective, with noise pollution around Stellwagen bank cited as an example of how proper mitigation is impacting the growth of whale populations.

The authors used 17 years of data from CalCOFI spring cruises to examine spatial distributions and correlations with oceanographic features of 7 seabirds. Seabird density was estimated from visual shipboard transect surveys, oceanographic data was collected using CTDs, and prominent hydrographic features were identified using surface DyHt fields. Sea bird distributions were related to minimum distance of survey bin centroids to the core of the California current, all eddies, cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies, mean DyHt, DyHt gradient, mean chl-a and mean nitrate concentration. Point conception and waters South were identified as an area of exceptionally high chl-a concentration. This was the first study to document responses of top marine predators with mesoscale features over long time scales, showing that despite their variability in time and space, mesoscale eddies are a prevalent hydrographic habitat feature. There were signififcant differences in abundance of each species which could be explained by differences in timing of surveys and year to year differences in the timing of the transition period from low energy to high energy upwelling. 3 pelagic species were shown to associate with eddies in the region, specifically around the edges of eddies and meandering features which may serve to concentrate prey. Reinforcing this, species occurence decreased with increasing distance from eddy/meander. Past research has shown that the location and timing of spring spawning for sardine and anchovy, prey species, is also associated with hydrographic gradients.

The authors proposed that whiting aggregate on 0-group cod at smaller spatial scales, that they will feed on these schools over several days and have a severe impact on prey density which could have sweeping impacts to the entire North Sea, that high catches of large whiting do not occur in isolation at small spatial scales, and that predation hotspots are difficult to detect in large scale surveys. Using stomach contents and models, the authors created regressions to determine the response of whiting to 0-group dense patches of cod. Stomach content analysis found that whiting did prey exclusively on cod in a predation hotspot which had persisted for at least 5 days. If prey aggregations are detected by roaming whiting, they are in great danger from predation. Persistence of predation hotspots ranged from 3-5 days. High catches of whiting in the large scale survey were always accompanied by high catches in small scale surveys. The mechanisms behind cod aggregations could be due to larvae batches surviving at different rates depending on where and when they settle. Those that settle early are in prime habitat with low predator density and are aggresive to conspecifics while those that settle later are forced into less ideal open sand habitat and start schooling, but this is not an effective response to avoid predation as it increases whiting predation efficiency. Unfortunately, the study cannot show interannual variability of the occurence of these predation hotspots due to a lack of data, but the results do indicate how predation events can shape food web models (the importance of hotspots).",Y,"prey recruitment, prey mortality, prey abundance",species attributes,,,Questions paradigm of aggregation to avoid predation,

This has major ramificaitons for the persistence of the murre population as persistent bycatch can result in a decline in the local breeding population, which makes up 75% of the regional population.

The study suffered from the lack of a globally comprehensive dataset for land-based stressors, excluding site connectivity, and ignoring habitat conversion. Regardless, it was the first global analysis of its kind.

They included the date of first publication, species estalbishment status, species area of origin, and current maps of species distributions. They had additional data on fish to examine their biology and ecology. The Med Sea is one of the ""hottest hotspots"" of marine invasives. Per unit coastline, it has greater invasion density than anywhere else. This is due to high maritime traffic, aquaculture, and anthropogenic disturbance. Most introduced species were found in the Eastern portion, with fish the most evenly distributed among taxa studied. Most fish hailed from tropical waters as well and were shallow water, spawning, benthic carnivores, like the natives they are displacing. It is thought that currents also help to transport species as they flow primarily northward. Invasive jellyfish swarms negatively affected tourism, fisheries, and coastal installations like power plants.

They conducted hull surveys using a pole mounted camera of 12 vessels at 6 marinas around the bay of varying salinities and also compiled answers from questionnaires given to boat owners to characterize vessel maintenance, husbandry, and voyage history. Each vessel was also assigned a Level of Fouling rating from 0-5. They found that the most active boaters also tended to manually clean their vessels, keeping fouling lower. 76% of boat trips occurred within the bay. There was no relationship with time of last maintenance and biofouling cover and the same was true of biofouling extent, richness, or composition and boat usage. The authors posit that their results suggest biofouling of recreational vessels represent a connection between NIS source populations and San Francisco Bay as well as a vector of dispersal into new areas. This is one of if not the first study that has looked at recreational hull fouling. They argue that movements in the Bay are increasing the chances of vector activity, and that vessels that go between fresh and saltwater likely have less fouling due to osmotic shock. Therefore, they recommend situating new marinas in low salinity waters. The LoF ranking was a good indicator of biofouling extent.

The authors looked at anomalies in chlorophyll a by standardizing the values for each pixel, computing spatial means, and finally by calculating the proportion of months each pixel was >1 SD above the entire system-wide model. To test the metric in relating primary productivity to higher trophic levels, they used seabird distribution data from 2 surveys in the Farralones and the Southern California Bight over 3 different time periods. Seabird data also included 6 satellite tagged albatrosses, whose movements were compared to the FCPI. GAMs were used to discriminate between similarities and differences in spatial and overall mean chlorophyll a compared to FCPI. Kernel density in ArcGIS was used to predict seabird suitable habitat and suitable hotspots. They then spatially averaged FCPI and mean chlorophyll a with sea bird data to determine co-variation. Results indicated that, across time, high mean chlorophyll a concentrations were on the continental shelf of the San Francisco and Monterey Bays. FCPI explained >2x the variation in seabird density compared to chlorophyll a during the survey months. FCPI was only slighly better than chlorophyll a at explaining short-tailed albatross distribution. System wide analysis showed elevated chlorophyll a along the entire shelf (Washington, Oregon, Canada, and the Gulf of the Farallones), which matches previously known hotspots (Cordell and Heceta Banks). FCPI coincided with known geophysical features such as seamounts North of Monterey Bay. Compared to mean chlorophyll a values, FCPI showed greater differences over the mid- to outer-continental shelf, which could be due to upwelling and Ekman Transport.

",seabirds,Farallon Institute,41.397,-124.537,California Current,surface,"A Farallon Institute report about seabird hotspots in the California Current. Because seabirds obtain all food from the sea and are influenced by many of the same human stressors other more cryptic species encounter, they serve as good indicators of spatiotemporal variation in marine ecosystem structure and function. The authors conducted a spatial analysis along the entire CCE from Baja to the northern tip of Vancouver. They examined hotspots in the context of trophic level, taxonomy, latitude, and created hotzones of multi-species aggregations that meet the criteria for important bird areas. In areas where data was sparse (i.e. Washington, Oregon, and Northern California) the authors used habitat models to estimate abundances. The authors compiled data from the mid 1980s to late 2000s from NMFS rockfish surveys, CalCOFI, the Canadian Line P program that is avaliable in the North Pacific Pelagic Seabird Database. Species were selected based on those having sufficienet data to create robust maps, and those of concern. Data were binned into 10x10 km cells and species counts were averaged for each cell. Then, a kernel density smoothing function was applied to create a 1 km resolution distribution map. This resolution came with three tradeoffs; maintaining enough spatial detail and clearly defining borders of hotspots, smoothing data and retaining localized density estimates in the contour smoothing of the KDS, and selecting a density quantile that accurately captures the size of the hotspot. They used density quantile instead of threshold so the criteria could be applied evenly across different species ranges and densities. Results found 99 hotspots, ranging from 500-3000 km² with an average of 1664 km². Average hotspot density was larger for planktivores than other species, and clustering of hotspots identified 5 hotzones including North Vancouver Island, greater Juan de Fuca Canyon, Central Oregon, greater Gulf of the Farollones, and Santa Barbara Basin. The authors argue that comparison of predator and prey hotspots is a good way to understand marine ecosystem spatial dynamics. Limitations of the study included some data in Oregon and Washington originating in the 1970s, though characteristics of the hotspots such as bathymetric forcing suggest they remain largely unchanged and that the analyses are robust. Hotspot analysis did not identify Castle Rock in Northern California, which is a key area, likely due to the lack of survey coverage. The authors review Nur et al. 2011 and Suryan et al. 2012, and suggest their findings show similar results. Protection of the aforementioned areas could lead to population improvement by reducing impacts and enhancing foraging opportunities.

Notably, they play a large role in abundance and persistence of subpopulations as well as growth and sexual reproduction, serving as source populations for those further downstream. Understanding recruitment at the reef scale is important as this is the unit they are typically managed and conserved. Recruitment hotspots are well suited for protection because of their rapid recovery potential, but this also makes them candidates for extraction and tourism. For this study, the authors sought to find recruitment hotspots of 3 coral families at One Tree Reef in the southern Great Barrier Reef (northeast Australia) and examine associated hydrodynamic patterns, adult abundance, and habitat. They also performed a manipulative experiment to analyze whether larval settlement was influenced by water flow and substrate at settlement site. The authors placed unglazed terracotta tiles in 20 reef sites covering a lagoon and reef slope and recovered them over set time intervals to maximize taxonomic resolution and reduce experiment-induced mortality. To evaluate adult abundance, they performed large and small scale transect surveys, classifying habitat into 10 categories. The surveys were repeated annually for 3 years in the lagoon and 2 years on the slope. To estimate water flow, they looked at the dissolution of clod cards. They found recruitment hotspots for each taxa in the lagoon and slope habitats, suggesting high predictability. Pocilloporids had the most prominent hotspots and were found on the western side of the island. In the lagoon, hotspots were usually in medium water flow areas, but not all medium water flow areas had recruitment hotspots. The authors acknowledge other hydrodynamic factors such as turbulence, boundary layers, and micro-topography could affect recruitment patterns, and the fact that pelagic larvae accumulate in fronts, a common thread across many hotspot types. Recruitment hotspots of pocilloporids and poritids were correlated with adult cover, but this relationship did not hold for the third taxa.

The authors evaluated the reproductive potential of the seastar by measuring the percentage of gonad mass to total mass expressed in gonad weight/m2 (gonad index) and how this was affected by anthropogenic structures, notably, wharves. Prior to specimen collection, they conducted dive surveys in belt transects to assess local density and dispersion in sites near wharves and non-wharf sites as controls, and then conducted towed camera array transects of the entire estuary to measure broad scale distribution of the invader, dividing the transects into 5m depth strata. They found that wharf seastars had much higher gonad indexes as well as a longer spawning period compared to individuals not associated with wharves. Density was also greater at wharf sites than non-wharf sites. Strata examination showed a bulk of these seastars were in the 5-10m depth range. The authors then modeled different spawning scenarios accounting for differing amounts of dispersion and advection in 3D 60m square landscapes for each depth strata. Importantly, the authors noted that wharf hotspot reproductive output varies nonlinearly, having a more pronounced impact when populations are small, and less of an effect when there are sporadic pulses in recruitment or increased abundances of food. They argue that reproductive hotspots are an important target of conservation and invasive species control efforts as Allee effects can be leveraged by the targeted removal of species in these hotspots to reduce their reproductive output.

The model correctly classified species onto the IUCN redlist with 92% accuracy. The best predictors of risk were body mass at weaning, number of births per year, taxanomic group, geographic range area, and social group size. Species facing higher risk often had low rates or reproduction and correspondingly slow life histories. Curiously, social group size may actually decrease risk. The model identified additional geographical areas not captured by the IUCN where extinction risk may be high; parts of the Indo-Pacific, South Africa, New Zealand, Patagonia, and the western South American coast central African coasts. Risk hotspots comprised 1.7% of the global ocean but included a portion of the geographic range for 70% of the taxa studied.

The authors sought to explain why seabirds are good tools to identify potential MPAs, reviewed methods of identifying and prioritizing hotspots, how to implement policy in MPAs and marine spatial planning, and examine the steps necessary to establish an MPA. The authors state that a range of techniques can be used in identifying candidate areas such as tracking data and surveys. Information from these methods can be used to generate species distribution maps and predictive models along with thresholds for protection. In the land of policy, many nations have not implemented MPAs, and those that have often have no teeth behind them in terms of enforcement. Even fewer MPAs were created with seabirds in mind, with overcoming international law logistics and multinational agreements proving difficult. One good model however is the EU's Birds Directive, a multilateral environmental agreement (MEA) aimed at defining special protection areas (SPAs) for seabirds. SPAs are used for rare, vulnerable, or migratory species, which seabirds generally fall under, and countries can be held accountable if they fail to uphold their roles. Marine spatial planning, among the latest developments in MPA designs, utilizes an ecosystem approach to ocean management by brinding a wide array of stakeholders to strategize and create comprehensive plans on a clear foundation of goals and principles rooted in sustainability.

In a brief review of literature they cite papers noting that recruitment hotspots could be caused by a variety of factors including larval supply and habitat quality for juveniles. They selected sites a priori in reserve and non-reserve areas to capture hotspots and non-hotspots. They found that average densities of each species were ~3x higher in the reserves that had recruitment hotspots. Use distinctly high CPUE to define sites as hotspots and conducted an orthogonal sampling design to compare fish densities inside and outside of reserves. Reef area was measured using satellite imagery. Despite the proximity of hotspots in and out of reserves, biannual surveys showed a strong consistent difference in mean densities suggesting proximity was not an issue. Recorded fish were split into two groups, those above legal minimum size limit, and those below it, with those above being exposed to fishing mortality outside of reserves. They used N-mixture models to find the best goodness of fit between zone, reserve status, and presence of recruitment hotspots. The only term retained in the final model was presence/absence of recruitment hotspots. Overall, results suggested that recruitment hotspots enhance production of target fish species in reserves, and that rapid increases in fish production are likely if the reserve contains more than one recruitment hotspot. The authors acknowledge that variation in adult density through other mechanisms such as predation or increased self-recruitment may have a reciprocal affect on juvenile densities, but in their study they found that there may be a feedback loop with elevated adult density in reserves and high recruitment at specific sites. This finding is in support of reserve design theory that advocates for ""maintaining demographically relevant connectivity between recruitment hotspots and source populations"", and in doing so help achieve fisheries and conservation objectives.

Pre-existing studies in oceanography and biology, the existence of effective science networks, and positive collaboration/engagement between local government and industry, while not all started with the intent of studying climate change, formed the perfect foundation to do so. The area is among the fastest warming areas in the world, and researchers had already been publishing about physical and biological changes before the hotspot gained recognition. The small scientific community was highly active in the area and engaged with local government and industry, leading to rapid strategies to study and adapt to the coming changes. There were also many citizen science observations of unusual events, but there was hesitation to associate it with climate change. This led to removal of political phrasing in the creation of an official citizen science effort called REDMAP, which documents species occurring outside their normal distributions. Fisheries managers and fishers took the initiative to alter their practices, with managers factoring in reduced recruitment of rocklobster and aquaculture companies developing strategies to mitigate disease and other increased risk factors from warming waters. Advocated for enhanced monitoring of hotspots with more socioeconomic factors and movement toward stock rather than country management.

They then combined data from vessel-based surveys from 2002-2010 from assorted areas of the MC and an aerial survey in 2009 as well as monthly averaged remotely sensed environmental data binned into 0.25 degree cells to ID memory based foraging sites (their justification for monthly vs weekly). These variables included chl-a, SST, sea level anomaly (SLA), distance to main colony, and bathymetry. Other species included dolphins and tunas, since frigatebirds are known to associate with them during feeding events due to forcing prey to the surface, as well as boobies and terns. Logistic regressions were used to comprehend predator presence/absence, and GLMMs were used to account for individual/campaign effects. Environmental data were normalized and then incorporated into SDMs for each species. The authors used this info to calculate spatial overlap between taxa and ID high use areas. Results found that frigatebird distribution was determined by chl-a, SST, and bathymetry, and that chl-a and SST had negative relationships with distribution. Seabird presence was mostly associated with static features (bathy and distance to colonies) and that seabirds and mammals usually aggregated in the central and southern MC. The negative association with chl-a is likely a result of the delay between plankton blooms and maturation of the food web as well as the turbidity from these blooms which makes it difficult for these visual based predators to hunt. Mammals and tunas were more dense in the northern part of the MC. The monthly scale of the enviornmental variables was not useful for determining the relationship between detection of primary production and prey for predators, and there is no information available yet on this time lag for the MC.

The gravity center for each hotspot was calculated to identify the main habitat locations of chub mackerel. To examine periodicity of the chub mackerel, the authors estimated spectral density using a fast Fourier transformation. To examine spatiotemporal habitat availability, they used monthly averages of satellite derived SST and calculated the meridional positional deviance of 15 degree C isotherms. Results showed that chub mackerel hotspots had consistent temporal trends, moving SW over time, and 3 year moving mean curves showed long-term fluctuations. MPD15 had an interannual difference, moving N over the study period. The reason for these trends could be mackerel moving to maximize their physiological functions by taking advantage of warmer temps, and that the fish were restricted to moving with the currents and fronts of warm water. Isotherms could be a determinant in the distribution of adult chub mackerel in the East China and Yellow Seas. They also found long-term fluxes with the Arctic Oscillation and ENSO, tho indirectly.

The authors made use of observer data collected during CalCOFI from 1987-2012 (omitting 1991 due to GPS issues) and focused on a total of 68 species/taxa. An important difference from many other hotspot studies was the emphasis on hotspot persistence. Data were entered into ArcGIS and gridded into 0.7 degree cells, the size of which was chosen to reflect trackline effort and the layout of the other CalCOFI samples. Sightings per unit effort (SPUE) and individuals per unit effort (IPUE) were calculated by dividing the total amount of species or individuals by the number of 3 km samples per cell. Cells were standardized by subtracting the spatial mean and diving by the standard deviation, and spatial anomaly was also calculated. Persistence of IPUE and SPUE were estimated by looking at the percentage of time a cell's standard deviation was greater than the grand spatial mean. To facilitate comparisons between species, the authors used Jenks natural breaks optimatization method in ArcView to classify persistence into 5 classes; cells at 30% and 50% represent medium and high level hotspots, respectively. In addition to persistence, the authors also looked at trends of richness and abundance correlated with habitat data. To do this, they employed GAMs of seabird anomalies for the regions. In spring and summer, richness and abundance were higher near the coast and decreased further away from land. This is thought to be due to the bathymetry. Though numerically dominant, sooty shearwaters showed few to no persistent hotspots. Various species showed differences in hotspots locations in different seasons. A decline in species richness was observed, though this could be due to alternating warm and cool periods with El Niño/La Niña. Leach's storm petrel actually responded to warming periods by increasing in abundance. Further investigation is needed to determine the spatio-temporal persistence of sooty shearwaters, and an increase in albatross abundance could indicate that they are increasing or foraging conditions in the CCE are improving/areas outside are declining. The importance of these identified hotspots were threefold; (1) they are ecologically important areas with high rates of trophic transfer, (2) migratory seabirds making up some of these hotspots may exert significant top down pressure on forage species, and (3) effective spatial management requires information on the distribution and connectivity of hotspots. The authors conclude by stating that the dynamic height in the survey area is an important part of predicting spawning locations for forage fish in the southern CCE, which could be important for seabird hotspots. They also suggest that spatially-referenced numeral response models with forage fish and ocean conditions should be constructed to better understand drivers of seabird hotspots.",Y,none,none,"temperature, dynamic height, prey abundance","temperature, circulation, prey abundance",,

They averaged bottom trawl survey data annually from fisheries independent surveys collected from 1993-2012 to generate a delta log-normal boosted regression tree analysis. Environmental variables included current, distance from shore, temp, and salinity. Using the model outputs, the authors generated predictive abundance maps of 4 ray species together as a functional group and individually. Regression trees identified variables that best explained ray distrbution and abundance. Substrate was most important predictor of presence for the all species group in addition to warmer, more salty waters with higher current speeds. Individual species had more distinct habitat preferences. There were two noticeably large hotspots, one in the South not subjected to heavy fishing pressure, and one in the North that was subject to heavy fishing pressure, with a few ""thin"" hotspots elsewhere in the region. These hotspot areas coincided with proposed protected areas and agreed with other prior anlayses. However, their model is unable to distinguish whether high ray abundance is a result of suitable habitat or a lack of fishing. The authors argued that protecting the most vulnerable species in a group is an effective conservation strategy, as is ensuring the size of protected areas are enforceable and worth it (i.e. too small of an area may be too costly to protect and not do much good for species). They close by making the argument that an MPA's objecive is to protect the entire ecosystem or a group of species rather than just one species.

They created individual models for both eulachon and shrimp density and used these to understand risk of eulachon bycatch. They used a delta-GLM to extrapolate eulachon density in areas lacking data from shrimp hauls, and a GLMM to determine probability of occurence. After constructing presence absence models and positive models, they generated maps of abundance for shrimp and eulachon, compared to different data sources, and generated maps of bycatch risk. The study area was divided into 1 km grids and the SST and average fishing depth was used to project eulachon catch density. The two surveys were compared. Both surveys showed increasing eulachon over time, with a negative monotonic relationship with depth. Shrimp showed a positive relationship with warmer SST anomalies while eulachon were negatively associated with intermediate anamolies. High bycatch areas (top 10%) were found in coastal areas and consistent across time. These were South of Coos Bay, South of Greys Harbor, and South of La Push. There was a negative relationship between abundance and spatial variability. These relationships can help shrimp fishers reach MSY and mitigate bycatch of a protected species. Differences between models could be explained by shrimp vessels being better able to avoid catching eulachon and an increasing eulachon population.

The authors argue that while many geomorphic features exist for researchers to use, they generally only use a few, most often one, which don't effectively capture the ecological relationships investigated. To address this issue, they conducted a review of over 100 papers and extracted the geomorphic metrics employed, summarizing each paper in a database. They then conducted a simulation off the western Australia EEZ using 150 25x25 km sampling sites of bathymetric data. Values for each geomorphic variable were then calculated for each grid cell. Some key information from the literature review included the following: Static seabed features including canyons, shelf breaks, and guyots often lead to higher net productivity, a phenomenon referred to as bathymetric steering. This is very apparent around seamounts and thought to be a major driver for predator foraging hotspots which could be a result of their magnetic, acoustic, thermal, and olfactory properties that act as navigational cues for predators. Different taxa (and even sexes) respond to topographic cues in unique ways. More recent research has shown that landscape complexity is more significant in explaining predator hotspots than food, temperature, or human disturbance. For instance, foraging gannets were found in consistently high upwelling areas regardless of prey availability. In reviewing and combining similar geomorphic metrics to ID those most important, the authors show that most metrics are redundant and prone to colinearity and resulting biases. Researchers should choose metrics that adequately explain ecological patterns and processes without affecting simplicity, generality, and elegance of the models. The authors advise that a minimum of 6 different metric types should be used to quantify topographic complexity.

To do so, they assumed abundance of a species at a time and place could be explained by a random process using a hurdle model. They calculated the probability of finding a hotspot/coldspot with known hotspots by alternating the number of sampling events. Species count data was separated by season due to differences in aggregation behavior. They then conducted a literature review to find a suitable distribution to describe non-zero counts of seabirds.

They then review the environmental charactertics with respect to currents, sediment grain size, bottom water temp, salinity, inorganic nutrients, and sea ice cover. All but the NECS hotspot are bathymetrically level. Heterogenetiy of sediment grain size is thought to drive community composition. The hotspots vary in temp and salinity, with SLIP being the coldest, and salinity increasing from South to North. Sea ice trends in persistence and break up were consistent over time, with changes most extreme at NECS looking over time. SLIP has highest nutrient levels due to proximity to upwelling. Carbon uptake rates were highest in the summer with some hotspots peaking earlier than others and decreasing by September at the latest. There was consistently higher epibenthic biomass than demersal fish biomass, though the taxa at each hotspot varied. Low fish density was likely limited by the cold water temps. Sea ducks, walrus, bearded seals, and gray whales were the main higher predators in the hotspots.

Microbial diversity was determined using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Abundance of live and dead copepods in the wild was determined with tows in the same area at depth intervals from 30-300m. Copepod carcass oxygen studies showed the oxygen laced pellets became anoxic around 15-20% air saturation. Carcasses in the wild were about 4% of total abundance. The oxygen imaging studies confirmed that the copepods serve as localized hotspots of dentrification, with the possibility that even still living copepods also perform significant denitrification as well. In the wild, carcasses ranged from 4/m3 to 95/m3 and potentially act as a sink for bioavailable nitrogen.

The authors conducted ROV transects in 3 submarine canyons of the north-Catalan continental margin (NCM). Litter sources were split into either terrestrial or marine, with marine being split into maritime transport, fishing, and recreational activity. The authors also gathered data over 12 years and seasonal population density from 2011 to examine the effect of coastal communities and conducted 26 dives across the 3 canyon areas recording 70 hours of video data. Litter objects were extracted from stills and classified by type, size, and apparent weight. Litter density was also calculated from the transects as well as the average depth which was stratified into 3 depth ranges. Plastics were the dominant debris type (>70%) and most litter was of medium size. There were also interactions observed between organisms and litter that were either harmful or the organisms made use of the litter. The authors also conducted a literature review to determine the status of knowledge about litter in the deep sea. They found that marine litter studies started in the 1970s, litter abundance increased over time, the highest concentrations occurred in canyons, seamounts, banks, and ridges, many key physical factors of the environment were ignored, and a vast majority of the global ocean's litter status is unknown. Results from this paper support governmental strategies for litter reduction, areas to be protected, and provide guidance for where future studies should focus. They conclude that their findings are likely underestimates due to natural sedimentation, undetectability of smaller litter via ROV, removal of debris by trawlers, and difficulty in determining whether debris is biological or litter.",N,"canyons, seamounts, banks, ridges",bathymetry,"sedimentation, fishing","hydrology, fishing",,
Z,Young et al.,2015,Review,"The trophodynamics of marine top predators: Current knowledge, recent advances and challenges",Y,Abundance/Density,"""Climate change effects will potentially have the greatest impact in areas known as “hotspots”. The term “hotspot” originated in the terrestrial literature and is defined as an area of high species endemism and a conservation priority (Myers et al., 2000). In marine ecosystems, particularly pelagic systems, the habitat underlying hotspots is particularly complex as it is created by oceanographic features that are highly dynamic in space and time. Additional criteria have been developed to classify marine hotspots including areas of low diversity yet high biomass, high biological productivity and high trophic transfer such as the temperate and polar seas (e.g. krill and krill consumers; Cotté and Simard, 2005; Nowaceketal., 2011). Hotspots may also have a temporal component. In the Antarctic for example, humpback whales and their krill prey co-occur in “super-aggregations” in Antarctic bays in late autumn in a complex relationship tied to the extent of sea ice from the previous winter. How the potential loss of sea ice through climate change, and its role as krill habitat, will impact Antarctic communities generally is a major research focus (Nowaceketal., 2011).""",many,Deep Sea Research II,NA,NA,Global,"surface,mid,demersal","Spatial and temporal variability of marine top predator trophic interactions is much less understood than diet, and is likely tied to distributions and quality of prey. A brief overview of marine hotspots is given, linking them to predictable dynamic oceanographic processes such as upwelling and static bathymetric features like seamounts. Most models attempting to solve these short comings have taken a bottom-up approach, with little attention given to higher trophic levels and micronekton biomass. Climate change will likely have the greatest impact in hotspot areas. The authors then provide overviews of the various ways to understand trophodynamics including stomach content analysis, biochemical tracers, and telemetry. Plankton size structure dynamics, micronekton, crustaceans, and small pelagic/mesopelagic fishes and cephalopods are all important prey for marine top predators, which are discussed in detail. Cephalapods in particular are likely to be winners in climate change scenarios and play a major roll in converting small micronekton biomass to prey suitable for top predators. Early life history stages of top predators are very poorly understood, with bony fishes being among the most well known. Hotspots are important in designating ecologically and biologically important areas (EBSAs) for conservation and understanding the mechanisms of formation and persistence for prey aggregations that make up hotspots.  Research into these links will be crucial in guiding management to protect pelagic habitat. Interestingly, seamounts often have magnetic signatures that may attract migratory species, explaining their consistent roll in hotspot creation and persistence and they would likely be robust to climate change. Upwelling may increase or decrease with regard to climate change, which would affect prey availability. The authors close by providing a section on development of ecosystem models using knowledge gained in trophodynamic research.

The HARP was configured to record at a frequency of 200 kHz at 16-bit quantization creating a usable bandwidth from 10-100 Hz which should have captured all odontocete vocalizations nearby. Data analysis was performed in the Matlab software Triton. Oceangography around the seamounts changed over single to multi-week scales driven by upwelling and downwelling events. To understand which variables were most explanatory, a GLM was employed for species of interest. An unidentified beaked whale species was the most abundant (detected during 97% of recording days) and positively associated with higher SST and downwelling, while cuvier's beaked whale, second most abundant (detected during 81% of recording days), were positively associated with cooler waters and upwelling. These results suggest the seamounts are suitable habitat for deep diving cetaceans, though past models predicted a high presence of sperm whales which were notably absent in acoustic recordings.

An empirical orthogonal function decomposition identified the dominant modes of variability to tease out the relationships between predator, prey, and the environment. Results showed that sea lions spent less time foraging at sea when there were high nearshore abundances of sardine, likely due to sardine's higher energy content compared to other prey. In poor sardine years, sea lions spent more time foraging to meet daily energy requirements and less time resting at haul out sites. The PDO was linked to high inshore sardine abundance and the ENSO modulated coastal upwelling, also influencing prey availability.

Overall, they found that the focal hotspots will continue to warm, but may lose their status as the top warming areas. The East Australia hotspot showed the highest increase in SST, and some of the fastest warming areas were those in boundary currents. The model underestimated DIN in oligotrophic areas and productivity in shelf regions, due to limited resolution and omission of some processes. The greatest changes in primary production were not always associated with the highest change in SST, as this will only occur in areas already nutrient-limited and subject to vertical supply. The poles are expected to experience the first effects of acidification, and eastern boundary upwelling areas are predicted to suffer from shifting oxygen minimum zones.

Data were gridded into 50 km cells in Arcmap and each grid cell was given a score from 0-100 to indicate level of vector intensity using a scaling equation to generate a heatmap of risk. Results for commerical shipping found 6 coastal hotspots, with London being the highest. 9 out of 150 recreational routes were identified as heavy use, with 7 grid cells identified as recreational boating risk hotspots. 4 coastal regions for shellfish imports were identified as risk hotspots.

A CTD rosette to measure chl-a and capture water samples was deployed at each station. Chemical analyses were run to asses chl-a, amino acids (TPAA and TDAA), and DOC content. CHl-a and POC decreased toward the south, while chl-a and POC were lower. DOC showed no latitudinal or vertical gradients. Ice free stations had much higher chl-a levls near the surface, decreasing with depth, while DOC remained relatively low. Concentrations of chl-a DCO, TDAA, and TPAA were lower at ice covered than open water stations. Biochemical indicators identified hotspots around 75 m at ice free stations, with levels twice those of surrounding waters indicative of bioavailble DOM. The sources of this DOM remain unknown however and could be from locally produced biogenic particles, chemaustotrophic production, or surface phytoplankton production. These hotspots serve as important carbon pumps to the microbial community, particulalry in areas of low primary productivity.",N,ice,hydrology,"primary productivity, biogenic production","primary productivity, biogenic production",,

DOM hotspots are indicative of high biological activity. The authors identified these hotspots by collecting surface water samples from 5 cruises throughout the year and analyzing them using bioassays and chemical analyses for indicators including amino acids, sugars, and carbohydrates to examine how their concentrations reflect the spatiotemporal distribution of plankton production and nutrient limitation. They found that concentrations varied over salinities, with mid salinities having higher values of DOC, while amino acids and neutral sugars increased with salinity. Combined, these results indicated that the microbes present were capable of rapidly processing DOM and produced some metabolites resistant to decomposition. Neutral sugar hotspots were found day and night with less differences between areas, while amino acids were found mostly nearshore. Results agreed with previous studies and indicated major rates of primary production and zooplankton grazing. Grazing in particular appears to contribute to amino acid rich DOM hotspots, where nutrients and chlorophyll were high, and hotspots in general were higher in summer when plankton production is high. The importance of this work was that it is an important source of energy and elements for microbial foodwebs.",N,"distance to coast, salinity","distance to physical features, salinity",,,,

Results indicated that currents transported large plankton to different hotspots, and krill and copepod hotspots often co-occurred despite differences in max depth and swim speed, likely because of their affinity to remain near areas of high production and associated prey. The largest big zooplankton hotspots were downstream of upwelling centers due to a 2 week lag from upwelling to the observed max biomass.

Accordingly, the trophic hotspot index was positively correlated with upwelling velocity. Shipping and commercial fishing were found to overlap with trophic hotspots, and the importance of these hotspots to marine mammals was briefly reviewed. Drawbacks to this approach are the need for long time series datasets, and the coarse resolution, though given predators' long ranges, this second point could be less of an issue than originally thought.

They used global hotspot analysis in Arc (Getis Ord) to look at broad scale patterns in urchin predation risk, and then local hot spot analysis to look at the patchiness of predation risk which produced high and low risk values, with high risk values being predation hotspots. Environmental attributes of patches including canopy height and depth of unburied rhizome layer, perimeter and area, distance to nearest patch, percent of sand and rock in 50cm radius around patch, and general urchin abundance based on counts. Global and local hostpot analysis were carried out on these. Found that two local hotspots occurred, with one more intense than the other, and both eventually disappeared after the 5th day. Results showed that at patch level, predation was lowest in high canopy, rocky refugia, but highest in those environments at the landscape level. This suggests at different spatial scales the effect of rocks and canopies switch roles. This has important consequences for this alga environment as when urchin predation is low, the habitat can rapidly shift to a barren. Fragmentation of habitat patches across the landscape served to aggregate urchins.

Species richness was higher at the same two sites for both genuses, as was species occurence and reproduction. This may be explained by the closer proximity of the Kuroshio Current which would serve as a recruitment pathway for type 3 and 1. In addition, the warmer water temps at the two sites were likely the leading contributor for reduced overwintering mortality. 60-95% of the studied genuses were found beyond their native range, though it was unclear whether this was strictly climate mediated, but seems at least connected.

The present paper sets itself apart from past studies by looking at the spatial persistence of optimal habitat. Specifically, they created a model that explored presence and persistence of hotspots of skipjack tuna in the SW Coral triangle and demonstrates the association between chlorophyll fronts and habitat using remote sensed environmental data and poll-and-line tuna catch data.

In situ noise levels were recorded using HARPs to compare to the model predictions. Whale distributions were obtained from previously calculated habitat models and important boundary areas from Cascadia, as well as opportunistic sightings from Channel Islands NMS. Results indicated region wide exposure to vessel noise, with several areas in particular identified as noise hotspots. Differences and agreements between HARP and model predicted noise levels could be from the different conditions that affect sound propagation, more modern quieter ships than the vessel noise were based on, and coarse resolution of bottom type. As future work, the authors suggest examining seasonality, and conducting a risk assessment using minimum and maximum noise values, as well as expanding to other frequencies. Metrics are also needed to determine consequences of noise exposure. The Channel Islands overall were the quietest area.",N,"substrate, vessel type","substrate, shipping",,,,Y

Supply comes from microbial fixation, loss comes from fixation under low-O2 conditions where microbes use nitrate in lieu of oxygen for organic decomposition. The balance between these two processes is offset. Not much is known about temporal variation of dentrification and its roll in processes. In the Eastern Tropical Pacific, 2 out of 3 total massive low oxygen zones are found. The dentrification process here is affected by switches between El Niño and La Niña, with rates high during La Niña as the low-oxygen boundary waters are higher in the water column but recede during El Niño's Southern Oscillation. This has major implications for the planet's oceanic nitrogen budget, with pressing challenges including obtaining better spatial and temporal coverage to get at the physical and biological relationships of denitrification and the generation of models with the capability to accurately simulate denitrification amplification.",N,"El Niño, La Niña",hydrology,,,,

The authors looked at the distribution of striped dolphin, bluefin tuna, Mediterranean shearwater, and loggerhead sea turtles in the Tyyhenian basin, an area of the Meditteranean Sea between Africa and Europe containing at least 64 sea mounts. The authors coorelated seamount characteristics including maximum and minimum depth, absolute and relative elevation, base area, and maximum and minimum slope with animal abundances. Animals were surveyed over two separate surveys in 2013 and 2014 from a sailboat, with surface observations of each species recorded along with their position. For analysis, the area was subidivided into grids of 2x2 nautical mile (NM) cells. For each cell, the mean depth, distance from cell center to coast, mean seafloor slope, and distance from cell center to nearest seamount was calculated. Cells were determined to be presence cells if at least 1 species sighting was recorded during both surveys. Random forests were used to predict the presence probability of each species in the cells. The shearwater was the most observed species and tuna the least. Dolphin presence was driven by depth and seamount distance, shearwater by depth, and loggerhead by distance from seamounts and coast. Tuna's were the only species driven by seafloor slope folowed by seamount depth and distance. There were 2 seamounts where all species were found and where none were found. The model predicted dolphin and loggerhead presence/absence the strongest of the four species. The multi-species seamounts are likely a result of shallow peak and base depths coupled with wide base areas and high relative elevations as they take up most of the water column. Their attractiveness may be due to serving as landmarks for rest, food, and migration and predictable increased prey availability.

They also recorded environmental variables at 22 fixed sites including salinity, SST, turbidity, and sea state, as well as number of seabirds and shrimp vessels within 200m of transect lines. Distance to the main channel to the GOM was calculated as well as mean depth from NOAA data using ArcGIS. Data were stratified by date, time, day, and cell (500m2). Kernel density analysis was then employed to determine foraging densities (mean rate/square km)  and subsets were done on seasons and time of day. Clustering was evaluated using Getis-Ord General G Index. Results indicated the shipping channel densities were 3X lower than the Bolivar Roads, and foraging density was concentrated in 6 hotspots throughout the region, each with their own unique suite of environmental variables which were all significant except turbidity and water temp. Hotspots were in deeper waters closer to the GOM and associated with higher salinities, numbers of boats, seabirds, and shrimp vessels. This was the first study to identify cetacean foraging hotspots in an estuary, and the authors noted that hotspots would shift in space and time on both seasonal and shorter temporal scales, though the two main hotspots identified were stable over time. Static and dynamic features such as jetties, currents, and vessel activity either directly or indirectly aggregating prey is thought to have contributed to the formation and persistence of the hotspots identified. Akin to other studies, the authors found that dolphins preferred to feed on areas of steep vertical relief.

It became clear a lot of this effort was being carried out for the petroleum industry. After SEAs were done, surveys to identify commercial activity interest areas to see how they may impact the vulnerable hotspots, 4 of which were deemed most vulnerable. Importantly, most of these assessments were done ad-hoc and some fishery relevant areas were included in later drafts of the plan. The US is lagging behind Norway in their development of an EBM implementation. Their ecological areas of importance were deemed areas of high productivity, biodiversity, species abundance, vulnerable and rare marine resources. The US split the effort up regionally across the country, with different regions having vastly different approaches and terminology, something the authors suggest needs to be remedied. They also have yet to actually identify their hotspots and there is conflict between protecting vs using an area as well as the application of science and coordination between agencies. Norway, because of its sea-based economy, viewed sustainable management of the ocean higher than the US did, even though President Obama had ordered executive orders for EBM in 2010. In closing, the authors suggest consideration must be taken into account if no legal status is given to protected areas when trying to implement EMB.",N,none,none,"bathymetry,fronts","bathymetry,fronts",,Y

These heatwaves are a result of low wind and surface chop and turbidity, which interrupts down-welling and overall mixing in the reef environment.

Core habitat was then IDd by choosing the top quartile of the distribution values for a each species each month. They then used slightly modified overlap equations to estimate where fishery effort and core habitat of the target species overlapped.

The US was 63% of fishing vessels and 68% of effort via AIS mostly concentrated in the US EEZ. High seas vessels were from Tawain, China, Vanuatu and Mexico. Hotspots of longline fishing were just outside of protected areas and core habitat overlapped with fishing across all species from 4 to 35%, with up to 6 national fleets on the high seas.

To determine the most significant contributor to hotspots they used a zero inflated negative binomial model. 631 strandings occurred between 2002-2014, with 84% being pinnipeds (78% of those being harbor seals) and 16% being cetaceans. Peak stranding for harbor seals occured from July-September and more strandings occured on barrier beaches than rocky shorelines. After removing public influence, 65 beach segments with large fetch and a gentle slope were identified as possible hotspots, mostly concentrated on the outer shorelines in the county. This study was unique in that its goals were not to determine species distribution or reasons for stranding, but rather, the spatial distribution and natural processes explaining it. Both hotspot methods had great overlap, as seen in other studies. Distance to public access points was the most significant factor in the models, which is to be expected given that strandings need to be seen to be reported. Distance to haul outs was not significant, though this may be due to the wealth of haulout sites and the fact that harbor seal distribution is incredibly dense in the area. Proximity to pedestrian beaches was not an influence on missed stranding detections; beach fetch and gentle slope were more important. Pocket beaches had more strandings than predicted, likely due to wave action and the relative isolation of human detection.

Krill biomass was obtained using a simrad EK60 with 4 frequencies, whale density was measured at sea with visual surveys during daylight hours as conditions allowed. The depth and distance to land and major ocean features such as the 200m isobath (shelf break) for each grid cell was calculated using a bathy surface in ArcGIS. Getis-Ord Gi* was used to identify hotspots of each species, and an AB ratio was used to assess overlap between the whales and krill. Results found humpbacks favored warmer temps, shallower depths, and lower salinities than deeper diving blue whales. Overalp analysis revealed spatial niche segregation, with blue whales showing greater associations with krill than humpbacks, likely a result of the more generalized diet of humpbacks. Blue whale and krill overlap was greatest off the shelf North of Cordell Bank, likely due to the aggregation effect from bathymetry on krill. Association with oceanography and climate indices confirmed what previous studies had observed, with temperature for instance being one of the most important predictors for blue whales. In terms of upwelling, blue whales were largely absent during low productivity periods. Blue whales tended to respond to conditions on a larger scale than humpbacks, who seemed to track enviromental preferences on a more local level. Hotspots for both whales and high overlap with krill occurred at the northern end of the San Francisco shipping lanes, which is a likely cause for higher ship strike numbers observed.

The authors make use of a regional ocean model system combined with NEMUCSC which includes nutrients, zooplankton functional groups, and detritus. The model results were evaluated using in situ data from the NOAA Rockfish survey. Hotspots were examined on the basis of intensity (Max krill concentration), duration (number of months concentration exceeds 1 SD above the mean), and peak timing (month of highest krill concentration). The simulation found 5 distinct hotspots over the upwelling season, each with unqiue characteristics with regard to the aforementioned hotspot properties. This suggests heterogenous dynamics control hotspot formation along the coast. An EOF analysis was used to find which environmental conditions were associated with patterns of hotspot variability. The leading mode for intensity was synchronous change with the southern part showing a greater response. Results suggested that interannual variations in peak timing are linked with hotspot intensity, meaning years with later upwelling result in greater intensity in the south and a concurrent decrease in the north.

As the sea ice melts due to climate change, species have a greater risk of expanding range, including invasives. This study sought to predict high risk areas for species invasions. First, they screened potential candidate species and ranked them using the Canadian Marine Invasive Species Tool (CMIST), totalling 23 species after the process. They then looked across the globe at occurence of marine invaders in native and invaded ranges using data from Ocean Biogeographic Information. Environmental data (37 different layers) were downloaded from Bio-ORACLE v2. They used maximum entropy in R to model habitat suitability, using multiple approaches to reduce bias of a single model and a package called biomod2 for comparison, with the ultimate goal of generating species distribution models. Once the models were validated, they wered used to forecast habitat suitability under prossible global change scenarios. They found sea surface temp and land distance mattered to every ecological group in the models, bottom temp and depth were relevant for benthic organisms, and zooplankton included sea surface salinity, ice and depth while phytoplankton were more driven by nutrients and minerals (iron in particular). Models indicated hotspots are likely to expand with warming. Just one species of zooplankton was predicted to have an increase in suitable Arctic habitat. Habitat was expected to increase for all species in the Arctic by 68.8 to 121%. Globally, plankton are expected to lose habitat while benthic species gain it. The authors state a lot of this will be driven by the increase of shipping (ballast water) and that the Antarctic could face similar challenges. Hudson Bay, Norther Grand Banks/Labrador, Chukchi/Bering Sea and Barents/White Sea were Arctic hotspots for invasion, which are notably special for various reasons such as other types of hotspots (biodiversity). The importance of these hotspots are they could result in differences in reproduction and phenology timing, trophic interactions and impacts on production.

Specifically, the authors aimed to document spatial patterns of predicted species richness, locate current and future hotspots of invasion, and describe how their results could be used as tools for communication and management. To construct their SDMs, the authors used maximum entropy models incorporating SST, salinity, and wave action, averaging each variable over a 3 month seasonal index. They calculated the center of gravity for current and predicted hotspots to observe how distributions would shift. In the Atlantic, present species richness predicted from the SDMs was from 0.2-11.1, and 0.4-11.6 in the Pacific. The Pacific showed a much greater shift in the center of gravity, nearly 100km NW compared to 33.6km to the NE in the Atlantic. They also looked at ecoregion and localized scales of hotspots, which showed differing results. The authors noted their results do not indicate large ports as the highest risk areas, despite high vessel activity, which reinforces the importance of considering natural dispersal and other nonanthropogenic vectors. The importance of this work was identifying where to focus policy, management, and efforts to maximize resource use efficiency. They found large scale maps most useful for communicating their results, while small scale maps simplified the information and helped prioritize and allocate resources. They argue that differences between observed and predicted species richness likely stem from insufficient sampling in the observational data, which then causes the SDMs to underestimate. These underpredictions could also represent source-sink dynamics or ongoing dispersal, and the authors suggest future research should incorporate currents and vectors of invasives as well as other environmental variables like pH when available.

Sites were selected based on accessibility via small boat and safety of crew, excluding rocky and muddy areas, with an emphasis on diversity of site characteristics such as proximity to cities and different locations in a river. Samples were collected in glass jars, in triplicate of low, mid, and high water where possible, and brought back to shore for lab analyses at U Birmingham. Microscopic and chemical analyses were used to identify and sort microplastics. Results indicated high loads at sites in Plymouth Sound, the Carrick Roads Estuary near Falmouth, and the Scilly Islands. While the first two sites were expected given their proximity to metropolitan areas, Scilly Islands, the highest of all, was a surprise given its relatively remote nature. There was high variability observed in loads at scilly island though, which could be indicative of sampling design and microplastic heterogeneity, failure to record local sources, and hotspots driven by natural processes such ocean current, wind, and beach dynamics. The authors propose that the loads are from nearby sources such as paint blasting on boat hulls, and the Atlantic Hotel sewer discharge. However, recent pollution restrictions have since reduced or stopped these activities, so future monitoring at Scilly Islands should continue to determine if these local sources were indeed the cause or if it is a distant source. There is great potential for negative impacts to the fauna in the waters sampled, with previous studies noting the harmful effects of microplastic bioaccumulation. The authors advocate that sites of high microplastic load should be deemed areas of concern due to their catastrophic ecosystem effects, with efforts focused on mitigating future pollution and removing current contaminants.

They found decent agreement with modeled and satellite measured chl-a and in some places high plankton/chl-a meant high benthic biomass. The interplay between biological and physical factors suggested distinct food supply mechanisms for the different hotspots. To analyze this, they used a lagrangian particle tracking model. The two main mechanisms postulated from the results of this model are the local supply regime, where production is kept local due to minimal current, and the advective supply regime, where topograhy controls strong currents over long distances, in turn, the location of hotspots.

They collected data on whale and forage fish distribution and abundance aboard Norwegian vessels running 60 nautical mile spaced transects each summer for 6 years during annual international ecosystem surveys. Maps of whale sightings and kernel areas for each whale speceis were created in R. Kernel areas were created using 2D kernel density estimation to assess whether biotic or abiotic variables differed between areas where whales were present or absent. The survey was divided into two groups based on this analysis, either inside or outside of kernel areas.  The two areas were compared using lenaer mixed-effects models or generalized linear mixed-effects model using biological samples and abiotic measurements as covariates. Abiotic variables included CTD measurements and bottom depth. The authors attempted maximum entropy analysis but small prey and environmental variable data were incomplete and the model did not perform well so it was not reported on. Analysis found significantly fewer mackerel in kernel areas than outside while capelin were most likely to co-coccur with humpbacks and fin whales. The largest capelin occurences were consistently found with largest continous abundance hotspot of whales. Fin whales displayed an unusually strong association with blue whiting near the Faroe islands compared to other time periods which could be due to the co-occurnece of blue whiting co-occuring with a large school of fin whales during one summer. Fin whales were hypothesized to avoid mackerel despite their high energetic content due to the evasive maneuvering techniques mackerel employ, making them harder to catch. In addition, killer whales often overlapped with mackerel, which could further explain why whales avoided them. Another theory is that the expansion of mackerel likely displaced other preferred forage fish and invertebrates (krill, copepods) which could further explain changes in whale distribution. Overall, results confirmed a northern shift in hotspot feeding areas of fine and humpback whales coinciding with mackerel range expansion during summer months and increased presence of killer whales feeding on mackerel which may be both outcompeting the balleen whales for mackerel and/or introducing potential predation risk to the balleen whales themselves.

Recruitment of larvae and density of juveniles varied among sites and year. Juvenile density declined over time with a high point in the 90s/2000s. Key reasons for the importance of recruitment hotspots were discussed including their service as vectors of population growth and influence on spatial variation and associated community structure. They can also help identify source populations as anthropogenic impacts continue to degrade population viability. These hotspots could serve as source populations to outplant in degraded areas. In terms of formation, there are many mechanisms at play which the author argues makes it difficult to discern. At a large spatial scale, water flow is a major influencing factor, though at smaller meter-sized areas, Janzen-Connell effects may be more important.

The model simulated changes in fleet behavior, like fishing only at night, proved effective in reducing probability of seabird bycatch. Hotspots varied in location and existence over the years, with changes corresponding to shifts in the gulfstream where seabirds exploit mesoscale eddies that aggregate prey.

Indonesia is the second largest exporter of grouper and snapper. Current management practices are based on total allowable catch per species group, e.g. snappers being an entire group. The study area included 11 fishery management areas in the Indonesian EEZ, making use of catch and fishing data from 384 vessels collected via a data recording system. The three major fishing gear types were dropline, longline, and mix gear. Environmetal variables including depth, roughness, and bathymetric position index were examined and a canonical correspondence analysis was performed to find the relationship between fishing and environmental variables. To determine what factors most contributed to high juvenile catches, the authors constructed a GAM in R using the mgcv package. To find hotspots, they ran model simulations in the EEZ using a 0.1 degree grid interpolating depth, roughness and BPI for each fishing event and filtered for cells containing >% juveniles in the catch. These were then overlapped with existing MPA boundaries to see how well the hotspots were protected and visualized in R using 2D kernel density in ggplot2. Catch assemblage was unique across gears, with longlines tending to catch the most mature fish likely due to fishing deeper waters. Results showed that only 2.4% of juvenile hotspots were protected by MPAs, with the Java Sea Makassar Strait area being the hottest. In addition, the results show that just managing the gear or depth of fishing is not enough to protect the exploited species. The authors discussed how successful MPAs can be implemented, noting that they would need more resources and a high degree of collaboration between vested parties to prevent fishing effort from just shifting to another location.

In addition, they suggested that vertical migration in the subsurface feature increases residence times along with shallow mixed layer depth and longer day length, creating a reliable mechanism of hotspot formation and a food resource for foragers such as whales and penguins. They used a fixed surface mooring with an echosounder of high reoslution and two gliders running perpendicular transects repeatedly during the austral summer. Scatterers were characterized in postprocessing, with krill swarms in particular identified from glider data (code available).

The authors compiled and synthesized paleoceanographic, archaelogical, historical, and modern records of temperature, biogeochemical cycling, organism hardparts, circulation models, food web and ecosystem structure, and human influence from direct and inferred observations as well as modeled hind and forecasts. They found a 4000 year period of cooling followed by rapid warming as species such as cod reduced in size due to warming waters and increased fishing pressure. Together, this led to collapse of cod stocks and a change in ecosystem communities as warm-affiliated species followed warming waters north while those with an affinity for cold water moved deeper and poleward. Changes in plankton community structure from monitoring surveys over the past several decades found similar results. Multiple model projection studies found that declines in thermal habitat and biomass of important species are predicted to increase with climate change. This has major ramifications for ecosystems as a whole, with climate change producing conditions not seen in nearly 4,000 years. This will likely lead to more fish stock collapses and challenge species' abilities to adapt or migrate to more favorable conditions. Looking at past data, there have not been major changes in relative abundance, composition, or size of harvested fish explained by climate change from 4000-1000 years ago. This may be due to the slower rate of climate change during that period allowing for adaptation, higher pre-exploitation abundances making species more resilient to disturbance, or forced into other open niches in less optimal conditions. Today's species could respond more rapidly if habitats and niches are available or they may be more vulnerable and sensitive to combined human and natural impacts. The authors conclude that a conservation and management process with an emphasis on adaptive, ecosystem-based precautionary approaches is needed to account for shifting historical and future baselines, manage exploitation rates, and develop climate-informed reference points. Strategies should account for warm-induced shifts in productivity, species assemblage and food web structure including increased monitoring, and a reduction in fishing pressure to increase resiliency. These actions will help maintain hotspots and help meet the US goal of 30% ocean protection by 2030.

Latitudinal dististances were calculated between the historical southern latitude in a given region per species. Species traits analyzed included trophic category, reproductive mode, adult mobility, range size, water column position, and habitat. Environmental variables included climate velocities and eddy kinetic energy. They also examined thermal displacement resulting from marine heat waves and cold spells as potential drivers of species displacements. There was not a clear temporal trend in range extension observations, but climate velocity was positive over the last 25 years indicative of widespread SST warming. Climatic extreme metrics also had high values with no clear spatial patterns. Positive relationships were observed between latitudinal and coastal extension distances with significant positive relationships with climate velocity. Position in the water column and trophic category were significant predictors of coastal extension and latitudinal extension distances respectively, with herbivores moving the least. There was a complex interactive relationship between climate velocity, directional agreement, and current speed on extension distances on the SE and SW coasts of Australia. These results suggest that current speed and alignment with thermal gradients influence early stages of range extensions driven by warming events, with ramifications for biodiversity distributions. Predators may range extend faster given their greater mobility. Future work should examine other species traits that could be more important.

Overall, observed strandings were higher than predicted with regards to climate change. Few if any changes were observed in the SE US by comparison.

The authors also compared oceanic and coastal trend differences of marine heat waves stress and a heat budget analysis for the upper 50-m of the water column in each system. The enhanced thermal stratification of the California Current and BCS systems during greenhouse warming made upwelling more efficient at cooling the sea surface despite weakened or no observed changes in upwelling, suggesting thermal stratification is more important than upwelling strength.

They calculated an annual entanglement rate and potential exposure areas after compiling relevant literature from a google scholar search. The model was designed to evaluate entanglement rates, plastic debris concentrations in exposure areas, and the size of said exposure areas. The model predicted 50% of species will be affected when plastic debris concentrations exceed 7.8 kg/km2. Coastlines had the highest likelihoods, particularly the Atlantic coast off the Bahamas as well as Southeast Asia coastal areas. In MPAs, it was found that the impact equated to that of the whole ocean, suggesting that MPAs are effective at protecting species from entanglement, though this could also just be due to their distance from source areas, as areas like the Mediterranean where small MPAs overlap with high pollution showed higher impact. The authors conclude that many areas will require multinational efforts to resolve given the cross-boundary nature of hotspots. In addition, they admit entanglement estimates were biased toward species easily observed like seals, and sea turtles. Oceanographic features with elevated impact possibilities included ocean gyres, coastlines and semi-enclosed regions, and were in agreement with known plastic hotspots.

From the whale shark data, they found that the sharks would show small degrees of movement between local areas and then undertake large scale movements across oceans to other aggregation sites. Vessel density estimates were calculated based on AIS data for those over 300 GT with maps revealing numerous trans-oceanic shipping routes (90th percentile of unique vessel counts in .25 degree cell). These vessels were mostly cargo and tanker ships with minimal spatial variation on a monthly scale and greater densities in the latter half of the year on a more broad scale. They also found low temporal isolation in vessel density with regard to whale shark range, suggesting the shipping routes were consistent. The authors were interested in close-range shark-vessel interactions. They found that sharks traveling between aggregation sites routinely crossed high vessel traffic areas mutliple times in a journey, and vessels were often moving 10x faster than the sharks close aboard. Mean monthly spatial overlap ranged from 86.6-100% between sharks and vessels, with cargo vessels being the most encountered vessel type overall. Regionally, fishing vessels were most encoutnered in the east Pacific (40% higher than the western half). To estimate collision risk with whale sharks, the authors calculated a collision risk index (CRI) as the product between potential vessel exposure and shark spatial density on a monthly basis. The overall assumption was that whale sharks with a high degree of overlap in high vessel density areas would be most at risk of collision. Shark behavior also has a role, such as how deep they are, and they appear to not respond until a vessel is very close. CRIs were highest in the northwest Indian Ocean, North Atlantic, and East Pacific. The lowest values were in the South Atlantic and southwest Indian Ocean. Hotspots of CRI were found in all oceans. Coastal regions usually had the highest CRI values likely due to the proximity of active ports. Taking a closer look at the rate of tag failure, the authors found that 14.5% of tags were likely a tag failure, while some 85.5% of failures were likely a result of lethal ship strikes that were undetected or unreported by the involved vessels. Accordingly, the authors suggest this study likely underestimates the level and risk of mortality these sharks face from ship collisions, and can be used as a framework to study other large and highly migratory marine species. In terms of solutions, they propose an international reporting scheme for collisions, separating vessels from high use areas, and implementing speed restrictions when that isn't feasible.

Results suggested that turtle watch had not reduced loggerhead interactions, fishing behavior hadn't changed, and that a better incentive program was needed than a hard cap limit for the fishery, as the cost of few vessels having more turtle interactions and closing the fishery was born by the entire fleet. In 2019, this cost shifted to inidivdual boats, with a max of 5 trips with vessel interactions preventing them from fishing until remedial action was taken.

Catch data spanned 2002-2018 and was converted to monthly effort and total number and gridded in 0.5 degree lat/lon resolution. Environmental variables examined included SST, SSH, chl-a, salinity, and bathymetry. 2 GAMs using a tweedie and binomial distribution were fit to the identify association with oceanographic features and spatiotemporal dynamics of blue shark relative presence and abundance. Manual backward stepwise regression was used to select which variables to retain in the final models. Lat and lon were the only interactive terms. Shark abundance and predicted probability were examined seasonally, averaging 3 months of each quarter together. The tweedie model explained more variation than the binomial with a positive assocation with salinity, SST, ocean depth, and months between March and August. There was a negative relationship with chl-a for both models. Several hotspot areas were identified, associated with seamounts. These results were supported by past studies and are important for fisheries management and conservation.
